at first,I set up a class called Record which include member function and member


data.there is a setStart function which can get the three variables(a,b,c) that 


infile from file.in and assign them to member data K,RA,RB.Then,outfile the


initial value b,c in file.out.next,I create a while loop to infile s continually.


inside the while loop,there is a if else loop to judge s in order to set up 


s1(actual score of player A) and s2(actual score of player B).then,I call the getStart 


function in class Record with argument s1 and s2,and it will return the updated


value of RA,RB and outfile the value of RA RB to file.out.then it will assign the updated value of RA,RB to b,c,and call the setStart function to initialize  


again.the above mentioned is the operation of my while loop .as long as the program infile s from

file.in continually,it will outfile the updated result of RA RB to file.out,and

it's the goal that this program wants to represent.
